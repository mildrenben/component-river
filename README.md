# Framer-motion-bobbing-items

## Usage

`yarn add framer-motion-bobbing-items`

`import BobbingItems from 'framer-motion-bobbing-items'`

## Contributing

`yarn link` in this dir. Then `yarn link "framer-motion-bobbing-items"` where you want to test it out.

You'll also need to [do this](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14257#issuecomment-595183610) for `react`, `react-dom` and `framer-motion`. 

Once these are done, you can fire it up as follows:

- `yarn start` at the top level. This will watch and rebuild changes to the component in `src` as you make them.
- `yarn start` in `/documentation-website`. You can now test your changes in the examples/documentation website and use it as a playground.
